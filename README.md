# projects.github.io
Welcome to my personal project portfolio! Here you will find a range of all the (relevant) projects I have done over the course of my uni degree (at UNSW).

I have attempted in the past to create my own portfolio website from scratch. However, it has not been updated recently. It remains undeveloped, due to the fact that I want to recreate it using industry grade tools (such as React, Bootstrap and AWS deployment), but feel free to see my first attempt at frontend programming!

I will list all projects, and provide a brief description for each, below (sorted by most recent):

### ass3 - Machine Learning
This machine learning assignment does 2 things:
1. Predicts the age of a policyholder in a car insurance company using a regression model. This model aims to reduce mean squared error
2. Predicts if a policyholder in a car insurance company will lodge a claim using a classification model. This model aims to maximise F1-score while reducing overfitting

### ass2 - RESTful API
Created a RESTful API which extracts relevant data from the Deutsche Bahn (German high speed train network) database and uses Google Gemini to create a tourism guide. The API contains the following features, all polished with endpoints and swaggerdoc adhering to RESTful API Design guidelines:
- Create and edit stops
- Get info about a stop
- Edit a stop
- Delete a stop
- Get operator profiles
- Get guide
This Data Service stores all data in an SQLite database, querying when necessary.

### ass1 - Data Cleansing, Manipulation, Visualisation
Extracts data from a csv file, stores such info in python dataframes, cleans and manipulates data according to a set of criteria, and visualises the data according to most relevant and informative attributes.
