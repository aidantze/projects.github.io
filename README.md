# projects.github.io
Welcome to my personal project portfolio! Here you will find a range of all the (relevant) projects I have done over the course of my uni degree (at UNSW).

I have attempted in the past to create my own portfolio website from scratch. However, it has not been updated recently. It remains undeveloped, due to the fact that I want to recreate it using industry grade tools (such as React, Bootstrap and AWS deployment), but feel free to see my first attempt at frontend programming!

I will list all projects, and provide a brief description for each, below (sorted by most recent):

## comp9321 - Data Services Engineering

### ass3 - Machine Learning
This machine learning assignment does 2 things:
1. Predicts the age of a policyholder in a car insurance company using a regression model. This model aims to reduce mean squared error
2. Predicts if a policyholder in a car insurance company will lodge a claim using a classification model. This model aims to maximise F1-score while reducing overfitting

### ass2 - RESTful API
Created a RESTful API which extracts relevant data from the Deutsche Bahn (German high speed train network) database and uses Google Gemini to create a tourism guide. The API contains the following features, all polished with endpoints and swaggerdoc adhering to RESTful API Design guidelines:
- Create and edit stops
- Get info about a stop
- Edit a stop
- Delete a stop
- Get operator profiles
- Get guide
This Data Service stores all data in an SQLite database, querying when necessary.

### ass1 - Data Cleansing, Manipulation, Visualisation
Extracts data from a csv file, stores such info in python dataframes, cleans and manipulates data according to a set of criteria, and visualises the data according to most relevant and informative attributes. 


## comp3411 - Artificial Intelligence

### ass2 - Search Algorithms Report
Report which analyses different search algorithms, including heuristic path search evaluation and alpha-beta pruning for 2-player game simulation.

### ass1 - Constraint Satisfaction Agent
Uses constraint satisfaction to play a modified game of Hashiwokakero: placement of bridges between adjacent islands which must satisfy the number on the island. The algorithm uses forward checking and combinatorics to try all possible combinations of bridge placements at any given island before moving to the next island, and checks if all constraints are satisfied before terminating. 


## fins3646 - Toolkit for Finance

### project2 - Event Study
*Group Project*
A project that performed some introductory data manipulation using pandas, before using the data to analyse whether total volatility has any effect on a long-short portfolio consisting of top-performing NYSE stocks. The event study was deliberately made unclear for us to figure out the null hypothesis for ourselves. 


## comp2511 - Object-Oriented Design and Programming

### assignment-i - Satellite Simulation


### assignment-ii - Dungeon-crawler game
